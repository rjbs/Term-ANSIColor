blurb: |
  Term::ANSIColor provides constants and simple functions for setting ANSI
  text attributes, most notably colors.  It can be used to set the current
  text attributes or to apply a set of attributes to a string and reset the
  current text attributes at the end of that string.  Eight-color,
  sixteen-color, 256-color, and truecolor (24-bit color) escape sequences are
  all supported.

description: |
  This Perl module is a simple and convenient interface to the ANSI X3.64
  (ECMA-48, ISO 6429) terminal escape sequences for color and other formatting
  attributes such as bold or underline.  The sequences are provided in two
  forms, either as constants for each attribute or via a function that takes
  the names of attributes and returns the appropriate escape codes or wraps
  them around the provided text.  Also supported are the extended colors used
  for sixteen-color, 256-color, and truecolor emulators.

  This module is very stable, and I've used it in a wide variety of
  applications.  Perl 5.6.0 and later include it in the core distribution, so
  you don't need to download and install it yourself unless you need a newer
  version than comes with your version of Perl.  I continue to maintain it as
  a separate module, and the version included in Perl is resynced with mine
  before each release.

  The original module came out of a discussion in comp.lang.perl.misc and is
  a combination of two approaches, one with constants by Zenin and one with
  functions that I wrote.  I offered to maintain a combined module that
  included both approaches.

requirements: |
  This module requires Perl 5.12 or later.  It has no other dependencies.

  In order to see color, you will need to use a terminal window that supports
  the ANSI escape sequences for color.  Any recent version of xterm, most
  xterm derivatives and replacements, and most telnet and SSH clients for
  Windows and Macintosh should work, as will the MacOS X Terminal application
  (although Terminal.app reportedly doesn't support 256 colors).  The console
  windows for Windows NT and Windows 2000 will not work, as they do not even
  attempt to support ANSI X3.64, but I have heard newer versions of Windows
  have improved support.

  For a terminal emulator compatibility list, see the Term::ANSIColor module
  documentation.  If you have any additions to the table in the documentation,
  please send them to me.

test:

  suffix: |
    The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
    present:

    * Devel::Cover
    * Test::MinimumVersion
    * Test::Perl::Critic
    * Test::Pod
    * Test::Pod::Coverage
    * Test::Spelling
    * Test::Strict
    * Test::Synopsis
    * Test::Warn

    All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
    not available.
